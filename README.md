RiskCalc_Aerosol_CloseContact_base_model contains the code for generating SARS-CoV-2 infection risk estimates using the QMRA-generated dose (base_model_functions) and a SARS-CoV-1 adapted dose-response model. Within this code you can modulate the infection control interventions (e.g. ventilation level, mask use (yes/no, type), handwashing (yes/no), surface disinfection (yes/no) etc.,). base_model_functions contains the code for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission modules: aerosol, droplet, and fomite (aerosol and droplet).

This QMRA base model code has been used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission (close-contact, aerosol, fomite) risk and risk mitigation strategies among front-line food workers in an enclosed food manufacturing facility. For more information, please refer to and cite this publication:
